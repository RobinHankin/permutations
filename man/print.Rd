Print methods for permutation objects
}
\description{
Print methods for permutation objects with matrix-like printing for
words and bracket notation for cycle objects.
}
\usage{
\method{print}{cycle}(x, ...)
\method{print}{word}(x, h = getOption("print_word_as_cycle"), ...)
as.character_cyclist(y,comma=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Object of class \code{permutation} with \code{word} objects
    dispatched to \code{print.word()} and \code{cycle} objects dispatched to
    \code{print.cycle()}}
  \item{h}{Boolean, with default \code{TRUE} meaning to coerce words
    to cycle form before printing.  See details}
  \item{...}{Further arguments (currently ignored)}
  \item{y,comma}{In \code{as.character.cyclist()}, argument \code{y}
    is a list of cycles (a cyclist); and \code{comma} is Boolean,
    specifying whether to include a comma in the output}
}
\value{
Returns its argument invisibly, after printing it.
}

\details{

  Printing of word objects is controlled by
  \code{options("print_word_as_cycle")}.  The default behaviour is to
  coerce a word to cycle form and print that, with a notice that the
  object itself was coerced from word.
  
  If \code{options("print_word_as_cycle")} is \code{FALSE}, then objects
  of class word are printed as a matrix with rows being the permutations
  and fixed points indicated with a dot.

  Function \code{as.character_cyclist()} is an internal function used by
  \code{print.cycle()}, and is not really designed for the end-user.  It
  takes a cyclist and returns a character string.

  Function \code{print_word()} and \code{print_cycle()} are provided for
  power users.  These functions print their argument directly as word or
  cycle form; they coerce to the appropriate form.  Use
  \code{print_word()} if you have a permutation in word form and want to
  inspect it as a word form but (for some reason) do not want to set
  \code{options("print_word_as_cycle")}.  See \code{size.Rd} for a
  use-case.

\examples{

# generate a permutation in *word* form:
x <- rperm(4,9)

# default behaviour is to print in cycle form irregardless:
x

# change default using options():
options(print_word_as_cycle=FALSE)

# objects in word form now printed using matrix notation:
x

# printing of cycle form objects not altered:
as.cycle(x)

# restore default:
options(print_word_as_cycle=TRUE)

as.character_cyclist(list(1:4,10:11,20:33))  # x a cyclist;
as.character_cyclist(list(c(1,5,4),c(2,2)))  # does not check for consistency
as.character_cyclist(list(c(1,5,4),c(2,9)),comma=FALSE)
