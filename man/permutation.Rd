\details{

Functions \code{word()} and \code{cycle()} are rather formal functions
which make no attempt to coerce their arguments into sensible forms.
The user should use \code{permutation()}, which detects the form of the
input and dispatches to \code{as.word()} or \code{as.cycle()}, which are
much more user-friendly and try quite hard to Do The Right Thing (tm).

Functions \code{word()} and \code{cycle()} are the only functions in the
package which assign class \code{word} or \code{cycle} to an
object.   

Function \code{word()} takes a matrix and returns a word object;
silently coerces to integer.

Function \code{cycle()} takes a \dQuote{cyclist}, that is, a list whose
elements are lists whose elements are vectors (which are disjoint
cycles); and returns an object of class \dQuote{\code{cycle}}.  It
nicifies its input with \code{nicify_cyclist()} before returning it.

A \emph{word} is a matrix whose rows correspond to permutations in word
format.  

A \dfn{cycle} is a list whose elements correspond to permutations in
cycle form.  A \code{cycle} object comprises elements which are
informally dubbed \sQuote{cyclists}.  A cyclist is a list of integer
vectors corresponding to the cycles of the permutation.

Function  \code{cycle2word()} converts cycle objects to word objects.

Function \code{shift_cycle()} is a convenience wrapper for
\code{as.cycle(seq_len(n))}; \code{cyc_len()} is a synonym.

It is a very common error (at least, it is for me) to use \code{cycle()}
when you meant \code{as.cycle()}.

The print method is sensitive to the value of option
\sQuote{\code{print_word_as_cycle}}, documented at \code{print.Rd}.
                           
Function \code{as.matrix.word()} coerces a vector of permutations in word form to
a matrix, each row of which is a word.  To get a permutation matrix (that is, a
square matrix of ones and zeros with exactly one entry of 1 in each row and each column),
use \code{perm_matrix()}.                                            

In function \code{as.word()}, argument \code{n} cannot act to reduce the
size of the word, only increase it.  If you want to reduce the size, use
\code{trim()} or \code{tidy()}.  This function does not call
\code{word()} except directly (e.g. it does not call
\code{size<-.word()}, as this would give a recursion).

\examples{

word(matrix(1:8,7,8)) # default print method coerces to cycle form

cycle(list(list(c(1,8,2),c(3,6)),list(1:2, 4:8)))

char2cycle(c("(1,4)(6,7)","(3,4,2)(8,19)", "(56)","(12345)(78)","(78)"))

jj <- c(4,2,3,1)

as.word(jj)
as.cycle(jj)

as.cycle(1:2)*as.cycle(1:8) == as.cycle(1:8)*as.cycle(1:2)  # FALSE!

x <- rperm(10,7)
y <- rperm(10,7)
as.cycle(commutator(x,y))
