To cite the permutations package in publications, please use
@hankin2020.  This vignette discusses the concept of cyclists as used
in the `permutations` package.  A "cyclist" is an object corresponding
to a permutation P.  It is a list with elements that are integer
vectors corresponding to the cycles of P.  This object is informally
known as a cyclist, but there is no S3 class corresponding to it.  For
example

```{r}
list(c(1,3,4), c(8,9), c(2,5))
```

is a cyclist of three cycles: $(134)$, $(89)$, and $(25)$.  It
corresponds to the permutation $(134)(89)(25)$, or
$\left(\begin{array}{ccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9\\3&5&4&1&2&6&7&9&8\end{array}\right)$.


An object of S3 class `cycle` is a (possibly named) list of cyclists.
NB: there is an unavoidable notational clash here.  When considering a
single permutation, "cycle" means group-theoretic cycle; when
considering R objects, "cycle" means an R object of class `cycle`
whose elements are permutations written in cycle form.  The elements
of a cyclist are the disjoint group-theoretic cycles; in the example
above, the group-theoretic cycles were $(134)$, $(89)$, and $(25)$.

A cyclist may be
poorly formed in a number of ways: the cycles may include repeats, or
contain elements which are common to more than one cycle.  Such
problems are detected by `cyclist_valid()`:

```{r}
cyclist_valid(list(c(1,-3,4), c(8,9), c(2,5)))
cyclist_valid(list(c(0,3,4), c(8,9), c(2,5)))
cyclist_valid(list(c(1.2,3,4), c(8,9), c(2,5)))
cyclist_valid(list(c(3,3,4), c(8,9), c(2,5)))
cyclist_valid(list(c(1,3,4), c(1,9), c(2,5)))
```

Even a well-formed cyclist possesses numerous redundancies: firstly,
because the cycles commute, their order is immaterial (the problem is,
in R a list is ordered.  It might have been better to represent a
cyclist as a _set_ of (group theoretic) cycles).  Secondly, the cycles
themselves are invariant under cyclic permutation: cycle `(567)` is
identical to `(675)` and `(756)`.  In the package, we need cyclists to
have a standardised form.  To this end, function `nicify_cyclist()`
takes a cyclist and puts it in a nice form but does not alter the
permutation.  It takes a cyclist and orders each cycle so that the
smallest element appears first (that is, it changes `(523)` to
`(235)`).  It then orders the cycles by the smallest element:

```{r}
a <- list(c(9,3,4), c(8,1), c(2,5))
a
nicify_cyclist(a)
```

Also, there are less serious problems: the cycles may include
length-one cycles; the cycles may start with an element that is not
the smallest (these are not serious in the sense that their presence
does not destroy the interpretation of the argument as a permutation).
These issues are dealt with by `nicify_cyclist()`, which calls helper
function `remove_length_one()`:

```{r}
a <- list(c(9,3,4), 7, c(8,1), c(2,5))
a
nicify_cyclist(a)
```

Function `nicify_cyclist()` is called automatically in the package by
`cycle()` so we are guaranteed that `cycle` objects are nicified.  The
package includes functionality to convert between word and cycle form
and the low-level helper function is `vec2cyclist_single()`.  This
takes a vector of integers, interpreted as a word, and converts it
into a cyclist.  Length-one cycles are discarded:

```{r}
v <- c(1,2,4,3,5,9,6,7,8)
v
as.word(v)
vec2cyclist_single(v)
```

This function is potentially a bottleneck and one of my long-term
ideas is to write it in C.  Function `vec2cyclist_single_cpp()` is
placeholder function that is not yet written.

Function `cyclist2word_single()` takes a cyclist and returns a vector
corresponding to a single word.  This function is not intended for
everyday use; function `cycle2word()` is much more user-friendly.

```{r}
cyclist2word_single(list(c(1,3,4),c(8,7,9)))
```

The package includes some rudimentary functionality to coerce strings
to cycles.  Function `char2cyclist_single()` takes a character string
and returns a cyclist:

```{r}
char2cyclist_single("(3)(139)")
char2cyclist_single("(342)(19)")
```


Above, note that the first call does not give a well-specified cyclist
(the number 3 is repeated).  Function `char2cyclist_single()` does
not return an error.  To catch this kind of problem use the more
user-friendly function `char2cycle()`, which calls the validity
checks.  This function returns a cyclist which is not necessarily
canonicalized: it might have length-one cycles, and the cycles
themselves might start with the wrong number.  The function attempts
to deal with absence of commas in a sensible way, so `(18,19)(2,5)` is
dealt with appropriately too.  The function is insensitive to spaces.

The user-friendly version `char2cycle()` performs canonicalization and
also checks for malformed cyclists.


## Package idiom

Most users will not deal with cyclists directly.  Function `cycle()`
takes a list of cyclists and returns an object of class `cycle`.  It
nicifies its input before returning it:

```{r}
(a <- list(list(c(1,2,4),c(3,6)),list(c(1,2),c(3,4,5,6,7))))
cycle(a)
```

However, it might be more convenient in practice to use `as.cycle()`:


```{r}
as.cycle(c("(124)(36)", "(12)(34567)"))
```
