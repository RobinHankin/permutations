This document discusses functions in the `allcyc()` family of
functions.

* `allcycn()`
* `allcyc()`
* `allpermslike()`
* `some_perms_shape()`
* `all_cyclic_shuffles()`
* `all_perms_shape()`

Although all these functions are pursuant to generating all
permutations of a given shape, each one is self-contained and at least
potentially useful.


## Function `allcycn()`

Function `allcycn()` takes a strictly positive integer argument `n`
and returns all cycles on set $\left[n\right]=\left\lbrace 1,2,\ldots,
n\right\rbrace$.  This is the lowest-level function in the series.

```{r ac4}
allcycn(4)
```

## Function `allcyc()`

Function `allcycn()` is a generalization of `allcycn()`.  It takes a
set of strictly positive integers and returns all cyclic permutations
of them:

```{r ac1378}
allcyc(c(1:3,7:8))
```

Thus `allcycn(n)` and `allcyc(1:n)` should return the same object.

## Function `allpermslike()`

This generates all permutations "like" its argument:

```{r aplac}
allpermslike(as.cycle("(12)(3456)(789)"))
```

Each element of the returned vector has cycles with the same
membership as its argument's cycles.  All possible different
permutations consistent with this are returned.  In this case we see
$(2-1)!(4-1)!(3-1)!=12$ distinct permutations.


## Function `some_perms_shape()`

Given an integer vector `shape`, interpreted as an integer partition,
function `some_perms_shape()` returns the permutation of size
`sum(shape)` with shape `shape`, and all of whose cycles are in
increasing order.  Thus

```{r sps2}
some_perms_shape(c(2,2,3))
```

Notes

* When creating cycles, the package uses an ordering system which
  means that the permutation may appear as either
  $(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot\cdot\cdot)$ or
  $(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot\cdot\cdot)(\cdot\,\cdot)$ or
  $(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot\cdot\cdot)$, as per
  `nicify_cyclist()`.  This can be confusing but does not change the
  value of the permutation [disjoint cycles commute].
* Permutation $(127)(35)(46)$ is present but $(172)(35)(46)$ is not
  (this is why the function is called "`some_perms_shape()`").


## Function `all_cyclic_shuffles()`

Given a vector of permutations, function `all_cyclic_shuffles()` takes
a vector of permutations `u`.  For each element of `u`, it returns a
vector comprising of all permutations with the same shape and cycle
sets:

```{r cl35}
(x <- cyc_len(3:5))
all_cyclic_shuffles(x)
```

If the argument has multiple cycles the same logic operates:

```{r acsac}
all_cyclic_shuffles(as.cycle("(12)(3456)(789)"))
```

In this case the single permutation expands to $3!2!=12$ permutations.

## Function `all_cyclic_shuffles()`


```{r baps}
body(all_perms_shape)
```

How many permutations are there of a given shape? If the shape is

$$
\underbrace{r_1,\ldots,r_1}_{m_1},
\underbrace{r_2,\ldots,r_2}_{m_2},\ldots,
\underbrace{r_d,\ldots,r_d}_{m_d}
$$

(that is, there are $m_1$ cycles of size $r_1$, $m_2$ cycles of size
$r_2$, etc; we understand that $r_1>r_2>\cdots>r_d$). Writing
$\sum_{i=1}^d m_ir_i=n$ for the size of the permuted set [NB $r_d=1$
is permissible] then I get

$${n\choose 
\underbrace{r_1,\ldots,r_1}_{m_1},
\underbrace{r_2,\ldots,r_2}_{m_2},\ldots,
\underbrace{r_d,\ldots,r_d}_{m_d}\,\,
}\prod_{i=1}^d\frac{\Gamma(r_i)^{m_i}}{m_i!}
=
\frac{n!}{\prod_{i=1}^d m_i!\cdot r_i^{m_i}}
$$

[stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1323130/how-many-permutations-of-cycle-shape-3-22-1-are-there-in-s-8)
has a good question here, the answer agrees with mine. He asks how
many permutations of shape $3,2,2,1$, that is,
$(\cdot\cdot\cdot)(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot\,\cdot)(\cdot)$ and gets 1680.
I get:

$$
{8\choose 3\,2\,2\,1}\frac{2}{2!}=5678=30\cdot 56=1680
$$

We can enumerate these easily with the package:

```{r, shape1223, cache=TRUE}
library(permutations)
jj <- all_perms_shape(c(1,2,2,3))
length(jj)
jj[c(1:10,1671:1680)]
```

### Further notes on `all_perms_shape()`

Observe that although cycles of length 1 are trivial, including 1s in
the argument to `all_perms_shape()` nevertheless affect the output:

```{r aps22}
all_perms_shape(c(2,2))
all_perms_shape(c(2,2,1))
```
