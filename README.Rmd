# Overview

The permutations package provides R-centric functionality for working
with permutations of a finite set.  It includes group-theoretic
composition of permutations and can transform from word form to cycle
form and back.


# Installation

You can install the released version of permutations from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("permutations")  # uncomment this to use the package
library("permutations")
```

The package is maintained on
[github](https://github.com/RobinHankin/permutations).	

# The `permutations` package in use

Random permutations on a finite set are given by the `rperm()` command:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(0)
```


```{r rperm}
(x <- rperm(10,9))
```

Above, object `x` is internally stored as a matrix (word form) but the
result is printed in cycle form by default, as this is easier to
understand.  We can print in word form if we wish:


```{r wordformprint}
options(print_word_as_cycle=FALSE)  # override default
as.word(x)
options(print_word_as_cycle=TRUE)  # restore default: we usually want to print a cycle irregardless
```

(A dot indicates a fixed point).  The package uses arithmetic
operations `*` to combine permutations and `^` for
conjugation:

```{r arith}
(a <- as.word(c(4,2,3,1,5,7,6)))
(b <- as.cycle(1:4))
a*b
b*a
```

# The megaminx

The *megaminx* is a dodecahedral puzzle with similar construction to
the Rubik cube puzzle that has 50 movable pieces and 132 coloured
stickers ("facets").  The permutations package includes
functionality to simulate the megaminx and exhibits an 82-turn
superflip.  The vignette gives an extended discussion.
